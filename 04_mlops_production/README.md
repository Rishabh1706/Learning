   - Implement traffic splitting between model versions

5. Feature store:
   - Create a simple feature store using Feast or similar
   - Implement feature versioning and lineage
   - Develop real-time and batch feature serving
   - Create a feature registry with documentation

### Data Engineering Assessment

   - Use synthetic data for testing pipeline robustness
   - Implement privacy-preserving data synthesis

### Responsible AI Assessment
1. Explainability:
   - Implement SHAP values for model explanations
   - Create visual explanations for model predictions
   - Develop a system for explaining batch predictions
   - Compare explanations across different model versions

2. Fairness and bias:
   - Implement bias detection across protected attributes
   - Create fairness metrics for your model
   - Develop a bias mitigation strategy
   - Set up continuous fairness monitoring

3. Security and privacy:
   - Implement differential privacy in your data pipeline
