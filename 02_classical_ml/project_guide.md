## Assessment Preparation

To successfully pass assessment, ensure you can:
1. Explain all mathematical concepts implemented in your code
2. Justify algorithm selection decisions with pros and cons
3. Interpret evaluation metrics in business context
4. Diagnose and resolve common ML issues (overfitting, etc.)
5. Compare different approaches and explain tradeoffs
6. Explain how you would deploy your model in production

## Tips for Success

- **Start Simple**: Begin with baseline models before complex ones
- **Iterative Approach**: Improve incrementally and document each step
- **Visualization**: Create clear visualizations for each major insight
- **Documentation**: Document decisions, especially when approaches fail
- **Research**: Cite relevant papers and resources that informed your approach
- **Ask Questions**: Reach out to mentors when stuck on complex issues
- **Test Early**: Create tests for mathematical functions to ensure correctness
- **Version Control**: Commit frequently with descriptive messages

## Advanced Challenge Extensions

If you complete the core requirements, try these extensions:
1. Implement a custom algorithm not commonly found in libraries
2. Create an interactive dashboard for model exploration
3. Compare your solution to research papers in the domain
4. Deploy your model to a cloud service with API access
5. Create a full-stack application that uses your model
6. Apply adversarial testing to find model weaknesses
7. Perform ethical analysis of potential model biases
